<h1>Virtual Machines House app</h1>
<p>Virtual Machines House app is designed to run on Apple Silicon based Mac computers.</p>

<p>
Virtual Machines House app can be used to create and view arm64 based virual Mac and Linux systems.
</p>

<h2>Linux virtual machines</h2>
<p>To create a virtual Linux system, an arm64 based ISO image file that supports virtiofs is required.<br>
For example to create Alpine Linux virtual machine, download aarch64 iso file under VIRTUAL section at https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/ and use it in the app.
</p>

<h2>Shared directories on Mac virtual machines</h2>
<p>
    Shared directories in macOS VMs are only available in macOS 13 and later.<br>
The shared directories are automatically mounted at /Volumes/My Shared Files/. They can be seen in the Finder.
</p>

<h2>
Shared directories on Linux virtual machines with virtio file system</h2>
<p>
To mount a shared directory of the host machine onto a directory of the guest machine, execute the following command on a terminal in the virtual machine.<br>
mount -t virtiofs shared-folders directory<br>
For example, to mount the shared directories of the host machine on to the /tmp folder of the guest virtual machine, execute:<br>
mount -t virtiofs shared-folders /tmp<br>
</p>

  <h2>macOS Restore Image URI of IPSW files</h2>
<p>
Mac images links table has 3 sets of the URIs of IPSW files:
<ol>
    <li>Hardcoded set</li>
    <li>Populated set</li>
    <li>User-Given set</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Hardcoded set</h3>
<p>
This set contains the URIs that are built-in with the app. Those are URIs of:
<ol>
    <li>macOS Monterey 12.6.1</li>
    <li>macOS Ventura 13.6</li>
    <li>Sonoma 14.6.1</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Populated set</h3>
<p>App periodically checks for the latest macOS version. The resulting URI is saved in this set.</p>

<h3>User-Given set</h3>
<p>User provided URIs are in this set.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Mac computers</h3>
<p>
    A computer made by Apple that has an operating system called macOS. Example: MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Macmini, Mac Studio, and iMac.<br>
</p>

<h3>Host machine</h3>
<p>A Mac machine that runs Virtual Machines House app.</p>

<h3>Virtual machine</h3>
<p>
A guest macOS or Linux based systems running with the Virtual Machines House app.
