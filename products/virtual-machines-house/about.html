<h1>Virtual Machines House app</h1>
<p>Virtual Machines House app is designed to run on Apple Silicon based Mac computers.</p>

<p>
Virtual Machines House app can be used to create and view arm64 based virual Mac and Linux systems.
</p>

<h2>Linux virtual machines</h2>
<p>To create a virtual Linux system, an arm64 based ISO image file that supports virtiofs is required.<br>
For example to create Alpine Linux virtual machine, download aarch64 iso file under VIRTUAL section at https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/ and use it in the app.
</p>

<h2>Shared directories on Mac virtual machines</h2>
<p>
    Shared directories in macOS VMs are only available in macOS 13 and later.<br>
The shared directories are automatically mounted at /Volumes/My Shared Files/. They can be seen in the Finder.
</p>

<h2>
Shared directories on Linux virtual machines with virtio file system</h2>
<p>
To mount a shared directory of the host machine onto a directory of the guest machine, execute the following command on a terminal in the virtual machine.<br>
mount -t virtiofs shared-folders directory<br>
For example, to mount the shared directories of the host machine on to the /tmp folder of the guest virtual machine, execute:<br>
mount -t virtiofs shared-folders /tmp<br>
</p>

  <h2>macOS Restore Image URI of IPSW files</h2>
<p>
Mac images links table has 3 sets of the URIs of IPSW files:
<ol>
    <li>Hardcoded set</li>
    <li>Populated set</li>
    <li>User-Given set</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Hardcoded set</h3>
<p>
This set contains the URIs that are built-in with the app. Those are URIs of:
<ol>
    <li>macOS Monterey 12.6.1</li>
    <li>macOS Ventura 13.6</li>
    <li>Sonoma 14.6.1</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Populated set</h3>
<p>App periodically checks for the latest macOS version. The resulting URI is saved in this set.</p>

<h3>User-Given set</h3>
<p>User provided URIs are in this set.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Mac computers</h3>
<p>
    A computer made by Apple that has an operating system called macOS. Example: MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Macmini, Mac Studio, and iMac.<br>
</p>

<h3>Host machine</h3>
<p>A Mac machine that runs Virtual Machines House app.</p>

<h3>Virtual machine</h3>
<p>
A guest macOS or Linux based systems running with the Virtual Machines House app.
</p>

<h2>macOS Tahoe Preview Support</h2>
<p>
  Beta 2 and above needed this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Device_Support_for_macOS_15_beta/MobileDevice_DeviceSupport.dmg">Device Support Image</a> to be installed beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Virtual Machines House app version 1.2 computes CPU count to half the size of the system's and uses the max of that with value 4. This solves the issue seen in version 1.1. Sample steps are captured at <a href="https://kumbaraasi.github.io/products/virtual-machines-house/creating-macos-tahoe-preview-vm.pdf">this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Virtual Machines House app version 1.1 by default uses CPU count value 20. This causes some troubles. Edit the slide and set to 4. Troubleshooting with CPU value 20 is captured at <a href="https://kumbaraasi.github.io/products/virtual-machines-house/troubleshooting-macos-tahoe-installation-with-cpu-value-20.pdf">this page</a>.
